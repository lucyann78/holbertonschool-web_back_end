This project aims to equip you with the skills to effectively paginate datasets. By the end of this project, you will be able to explain how to paginate a dataset using simple parameters such as page and page_size, allowing for straightforward navigation through data. You will also learn to implement pagination with hypermedia metadata, which enhances user experience by providing links to navigate between pages seamlessly. Additionally, you will understand how to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner, ensuring that your pagination logic remains intact even when elements are removed from the dataset. These objectives will empower you to manage data efficiently and improve user interaction with your applications.
