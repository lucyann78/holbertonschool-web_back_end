We will explore Promises to understand how, why, and what they are, enhancing our ability to manage asynchronous operations in JavaScript. We will learn how to effectively use the then, resolve, and catch methods to handle promise results and errors. Additionally, we will delve into every method of the Promise object, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of their functionalities. We will also cover error handling techniques using throw and try, which are essential for robust code. Furthermore, we will examine the await operator, which simplifies working with promises, and learn how to define and utilize an async function to streamline asynchronous programming.
