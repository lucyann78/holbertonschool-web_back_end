In this project, you will develop a comprehensive understanding of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and its features. By the end, you will be able to confidently explain what ES6 is and outline the new features it introduced, such as the differences between constants and variables, block-scoped variables, and the use of arrow functions with default parameters. Additionally, you will grasp the concepts of rest and spread function parameters, string templating, object creation with properties, and the utility of iterators along with for-of loops. This knowledge will empower you to write more efficient and modern JavaScript code.
