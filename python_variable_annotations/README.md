At the end of this project, you will be equipped with the knowledge to confidently explain key concepts in Python 3, including type annotations and their practical applications. You will learn how to use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types, enhancing code readability and maintainability. Additionally, you will gain an understanding of duck typing, a powerful feature in Python that allows for flexible coding practices. Finally, you will explore how to validate your code using mypy, a static type checker that helps ensure your code adheres to the specified type annotations, ultimately leading to more robust and error-free programming.
