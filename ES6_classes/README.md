In this project, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of key object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript. You will learn how to define a class, enabling you to create blueprints for objects that encapsulate both data and functionality. Additionally, you will explore how to add methods to a class, allowing for the implementation of behaviors associated with your objects. The project will also cover why and how to add a static method to a class, which provides utility functions that are relevant to the class itself rather than any particular instance. Furthermore, you will discover how to extend a class from another, facilitating inheritance and code reuse. Lastly, the concept of metaprogramming and symbols will be introduced, giving you insights into advanced programming techniques that allow for dynamic behavior and enhanced flexibility in your code.
