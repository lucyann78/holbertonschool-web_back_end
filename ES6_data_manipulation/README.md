This project focuses on data manipulation using ES6 features, emphasizing the use of higher-order functions such as map, filter, and reduce to efficiently process arrays. It introduces Typed Arrays for handling binary data, and explores advanced data structures including Set, Map, and WeakMap to manage collections of unique values and key-value pairs effectively. Through practical examples, this project aims to enhance your understanding of modern JavaScript capabilities and their applications in data handling.
